% a. are the results close enough to be useful?

% Yes the results are very close from numerical calculation
% 	and finding the Jacobian analytically.
%
% In fact, the differences are usually in the order of h^2,
% 	(e.g. when h = 1E-3, the difference are on the order of 1E-6)
%	Therefore, we can yield a very close approximation of the Jacobian
%	without too small h.
%
% This makes the approach very useful


% b. Why would you use this finite-difference approximation instead of 
%	the analytic derivative?
%
% Usually, we do not know the equation to determine the end-effector beforehand
%	even when we do, the equation are too complex to solve for derivative
%	analytically.
% Also even if we have the equation, it's usually not accurate in the
%	real-world due to factors like frictions and air resistance.
% 
% Lastly, once we have the algorithm for finite-difference, we can take in
%	any formulas for calculation, whereas with analytic derivative,
%	the derivatives needs to be calculated for each formula.
